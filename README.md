# NESP TWQ 5.2 Cumulative Impacts analysis - Factors that best predict coral cover change
This analysis looked at determining which were the most important factors in predicting changes in coral cover on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). These factors include acute pressures such as cyclones, heat stress, Crown-ofThorns Starfish outbreaks, and chronic stressors such as water quality metrics. A unique aspect of this analysis was to break the important factors into four key functional groups of coral types, allows us to better understand which pressures affect each coral type.

ACBX | Acropora branching & bottlebrush
